# sustainableHECAP

The website `sustainableHECAP` is an initiative by a volunteer network of scientists in the fields of high energy physics, cosmology and astroparticle physics (HECAP) concerned about the climate crisis and advocating for a transition towards a sustainable academia.

Following the workshop "Sustainable HEP" ([indico event](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1004432/)) in June 2021, several HECAP members started a reflexion culminating in a White Paper. This document represents a community-wide step towards identifying these impacts, proposing positive changes that individuals, groups and institutions can make, and highlighting the associated opportunities for improving social justice.

The online platform `sustainableHECAP` is the point of contact for HECAP scientists willing to learn, join the conversation or take actions towards more sustainability in HECAP.
